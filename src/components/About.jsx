                    <hr />
                    <p>I am an experienced System Developer with around 15 years of experience in building desktop applications using VB.Net and SQL databases. I have developed business applications for the corporate companies that I had a chance to be part of.</p>
                    <p>As technology shifted towards the web, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills into full-stack web development, learning technologies like Node.JS and React. Now, I shifted to focus in creating web applications by combining it with the knowledge and experiences I gained throughout my career. My latest corporate job was as an MIS Manager which allowed for me to engage more in collaborative projects with the various departments.</p>
                    <p>I thrive on building innovative solutions for the user's requirements. If you have any similar requirements for your business, let's collaborate and build something amazing.</p>
