                    <hr />
                    <p>I am an experienced System Developer with around 15 years of experience in building desktop applications using VB.Net and SQL databases. I have developed business applications for the corporate companies that I had a chance to be part of.</p>
                    <p>As technology shifted towards the web, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills into full-stack web development, learning technologies like Node.JS and React. Now, I shifted to focus in creating web applications by combining it with the knowledge and experiences I gained throughout my career. My latest corporate job was as a MIS Manager which helped me gain more experience in handling cross-functional projects with other business departments.</p>
                    <p>If you have any similar requirements for your business, let's collaborate and build something amazing. I am looking forward to utilizing these experiences and skills to be able to contribute to your business needs.</p>
